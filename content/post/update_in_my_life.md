so for one: i started going back to school which in many ways is a real good thing.
started up with a spanish class. i am hoping sometime in the near future, i will take a trip to spain or mexico! (within a year) 
i know i have been really slacking on my goals and aspirations.
<!--more-->
I stop and start duolingo and other practice for language learning. 
i have been kinda suffering with my consistency for my big goals. 

so one way i might help myself is trying a new website called [habitica](https://habitica.com).
its a website that kinda of makes life like a video game. 
its a todolist with extra game mechanics!
you write down tasks you want to complete for example lets say practice piano daily. 
so you write in your daily. and then you mark it completed you gain gold and experience!
gold allows to buy cute little pixel gear which can improve your stats. allowing to you beat quests faster!

the idea at least is as you make progess on projects in the real world you make progress on your virtual character. 
so far it is fun. i think it helps me keep productive throughout the day. 
you dont just have to buy cute little virtual items but you can make it so that you spend gold on custom rewards that represent 
real world items like playing video games. 

but also you can get punished if you put up a task and dont do it. 
thus if you keep with it you get more productive. 
please look it up and message me if you do join! call at 503-810-4033
i will join your party and hopefully together we can stay motivated doing our real tasks!

the panademic was hard toward the end. with school still being all online. 
I think that we all can get better and get back into the motion of things!
