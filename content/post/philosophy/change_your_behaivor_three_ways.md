i think are three main ways to change your behaivor. 
the first is to give yourself a reward for the right behaivor. 
for example, if you complete exercise give your self displine points. 
    these are a self created currency that you could then say if you do enough exercise, you can put a dollar towards a
    video game or something similar. 

the second is to punish. 
	if you dont do something, then something bad happens. 
	    this doesnt work as well if your doing the enforcement but if say a computer enforces or an accoutability
	    partner reminds you for this. 

and the third is to change how hard it is to do something. 
or otherwise known as altering the barrier to entry. 


if doing the wrong thing is harder than your less likely to do it. 
for example if you wanted to stop drinking soda. 
its probably best to not keep soda in the house. 
get rid of soda in the house and remove most indicators of soda in the house. so that your not tempted to even think
about soda. if  its out of sight, out of mind, and additionally out of reach, then your chances of drinking something
like soda go down considerably. 



because if you thought about getting soda and had to go to the store to do it your less likely to do it. 
if your goal was to start running. think about reducing the minimums for you to do it. 
have a nice pair of shoes in the right convient spot to do it when you need to. 
setup a reminder to go running on your phone. if you find yourself bored, or disintrested, combine with randomize
routes, music, podcasts, or partners. 

for me, i probably wouldnt stick with my walking routine if werent for my little brother and dog. 

i mean feel like after reading alot about behaivors, some coming from the good book the habits of highly effective
people.  have helped shape about what it takes for me to do it.
