<!--more-->
i think are three main ways to change your behaivor. 
the first is to give yourself a reward for the right behaivor. 

the second is to punish. 

and the third is to change how hard it is to do something. 

altering the barrier to entry. 


if doing the wrong is harder than your less likely to do it. 
for example if you wanted to stop drinking soda. 
its probably best to not keep soda in the house. 
because if you thought about getting soda and had to go to the store to do it your less likely to do it. 
if your goal was to start running. think about reducing the minimums for you to do it. 
have a nice pair of shoes in the right convient spot to do it when you need to. 
setup a reminder to go running on your phone.
