 we americans suck at peace. it wouldnt be a far cry to say the usa has been at war since its inception!
 i may not be great at american history but i can sure tell you we have been in a ton of wars.
  and this leads into my thoughts about the ukraine-russian conflict or invasion. 
  
<!--more-->
the most disappointing thing about hearing about this conflict is that makes me question everthing i am doing i ask what is the point of it all. 
and 2 that i very much want the invasion to end! i ask myself what can i really do. 
there is one problem  ai ma basically half way around the world.
