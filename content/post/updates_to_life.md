hi all. been a while i guess.  anyway, I guess I wasnt sure how to update my website for a while. 
I am starting to work on free code camp certifications for now. its easy enough keeps programming. 
hard enough to learn some details about various types of libraries or concepts.

when I do various projects in free code camp. I will post them here.
hopefully maybe then even get my brain thinking about other ideas that are even more useful. 
see you next time!
