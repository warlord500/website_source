i have decided i wanted to get rid of some of my old posts.

<!--more-->
the reason is these posts focused on old software projects that i know longer have the source code or repos for. 
you can find these posts in the history of my github project for this website! 
i dont really want to keep up the posts, if i can no longer link to the code!
