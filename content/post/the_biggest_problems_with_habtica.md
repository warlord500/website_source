about a month ago i made a post about [habitica]()
it is still my favorite todo app. however it does have some problems. 

<!--more-->

problem 1 task value/rewards 
a task reward is not directly controllable by the player with exception of difficulty setting. 
it has a simplistic system of trivial,easy,medium,hard. 
this has a great advantage versus another system like in doitNowRpg which has a continous range of values for tasks. 

you avoid paralysis by analysis. basically, you spend more time fine tuning the rewards of tasks than actually completing the tasks themselves. 
i personally felt that doitNowRpg had too much choice, made it hard to figure out how much rewards to give. 
while the opposite problem sort of occurs in habitica. not enough choice sometimes


it simplifies the choice. it has that draw back that sometimes you want a task to be worth more but with habitica limitations on difficulty setting. 
you might ask how do you do that?  this is where habitica encourages you break a task into multiple parts. because each part itself might be easy, you might just say to your self. 
okay, i can finish this part. once you do that you finish another part and then another part. and before you know it you have finished the project!! 

this itself can be motivating!! i feel that this is more in the long run probably a pro but sometimes feels like a con! 


one other big then that i am sort of both annoyed and grateful for is socialization, the working together to beat the boss.  
as everyone compelete their own daily tasks. they do damage to a quest boss or if they fail they do damage to themselves and the party! 
i grateful for it because, i like the idea of trying to help others out, while on the other hand, this can be annoying when party members in habitica, quit the app. 
no longer stay productive via habitca! this probably a party problem, that only occurs occasionally.


one other problem with habitica, is the simplicity of task rewards. habitica rewards every time you complete a task more gold, mana, and xp. 
additonally damage and drop chance. drops are received randomly which can be encouraging because the more tasks you complete the more drops! 
i personally think about other rpg games. and think about the rewards of those games for like equipment are more complex and random. 

the problem with that is that it doesnt fit with a lot of habitica! habitica is designed to be simple enough most people can use it. and having more complexity ruins that. as well as be demotivating, 
where one of the goals of habitica is to be motivating. 

despite of all of habiticas problems, i think i will still stick with it because i feel this game/productivity tool is a little bit fun , as well as helpful! 
thanks for reading jadon!!
