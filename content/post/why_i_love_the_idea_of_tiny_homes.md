i have always been facisinated with idea of a tiny home. 
a home that specifically designed to be small and extremely effecient in every sense because it has to.

<!--more-->

also a big realization that alot of space doesnt neccesarily mean better. 
for example one major draw back to larger homes means more cleaning/matinence. 
nobody really likes cleaning more than they have to? right? 
so why buy a big home then spend more money on it in every sense but not really enjoy it because of the expense. 

tiny homes can be far cheaper than a traditional sized house because there is less work to do and less resources used for it too. 

one other that fascinates me about tiny homes is the creative space utilization that developers come up with. 
though with some of my hobbies a bit of real space is necessary. 
doesnt mean you can't dream of a rather small home with cool engineering built right in.
