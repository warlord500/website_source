in real life, people are like any other animal on the planet. now i have a rule for myself that i try to live by if its worth complaining about, then its worth doing something about it. 
now there is only one problem, with that philosophy, and that is sometimes the thing i am complaining about might be another perosns a ction. 
and  maybe  iwould lto adjust theri action towrad me in some way. 


as it turns out, you can lead people to the afroementioned water but you must  let the other peerson decide to take taht  drink. 


trying to force them  to change wil likely on ly make them bush back instead of doing the very thing you want them todo.
