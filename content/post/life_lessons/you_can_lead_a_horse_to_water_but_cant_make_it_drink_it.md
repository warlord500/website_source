people are like horses in the quote in the title. 
the reason i am writing this because i try to follow a rule in that if something is worth complaining about then its worth doing something about it!


<!--more-->

so, if i have something to compain about. and that involves another person for example say  iasked my little botehre  to take  a walk in  the morning. 
and night he doesnt do it. 

when i complain instead ask if i am doing somehting ask i f a i am doing everthiyn g  i can to selel it to higher investors!
