in real life, people are like any other animal on the planet. now i have a rule for myself that i try to live by if its worth complaining about, then its worth doing something about it. 
now there is only one problem, with that philosophy, and that is sometimes the thing i am complaining about might be another perosns a ction. 
and  maybe  iwould lto adjust theri action towrad me in some way. 


as it turns out, you can lead people to the afroementioned water but you must  let the other peerson decide to take taht  drink. 


trying to force them  to change wil likely on ly make them bush back instead of doing the very thing you want them todo. 

people are like horses in the quote in the title. 
the reason i am writing this because i try to follow a rule in that if something is worth complaining about then its worth doing something about it!

so, if i have something to compain about. and that involves another person for example say  iasked my little botehre  to take  a walk in  the morning. 
and night he doesnt do it. 

when i complain instead ask if i am doing somehting ask i f a i am doing everthiyn g  i can to selel it to higher investors!
