i have been journalling for nearly 5 years even at the age of 23. 
i have learned a few things about it along the way. 

<!--more-->

when i first started journaling, i really was just overwelmed with emotions. 
i think i had some episodes of depression. i went to a different school to some of my long time friends which means i had to make new friends. 
which if you ever had to make new friends then you know how hard that can be. 

its was more scattered at that time. but i soon realized that writing down what i felt made me feel better. 
either less anxious, stressed or even simply overwelmed. lots of times it was loneliness, it didnt make that go away but at least it helped me to realize i  could challenge the emotion.\
or deep sadness/depression, there were times it was hard to simply even get up in the morning let alone, to even somewhat do normal things like go to school have hobbies be friends with others.
i would ask myself what do i want today?, and i could come up with answer. i mean i think most people can come up with an answer but i couldnt. i have realized it i think its the wrong question. 
later i will explain why. 

for a while it worked, then i stopped. my main driver wasnt there, however, after few i came to another realization that even on good days a journal can make it even better or at least reminder that 
no matter what, there are a few moments of good. 

this self reflection came with one huge problem. what do i write on a good day? that was the challenge. i tried several changes over the years. 
one year was list chores i wanted to complete every day. 

the chore list was just a todo list not a helpful guide for writing in a journal and honestly just invoked feeling of guilt. 
which wasnt  necesary. honestly it made the journal do much of the opposite of the goal. 

eventually i switched to a different strategy. one was a daily question prompt. i had picked question prompts from pintrest and ask myself one every day. 
while i did enjoy it and it did give me something to write. there were to main problems with it. one it was hard to keep track of the exact day number it was and 
when i had started, i started in the middle of the year, which feel like it feel the whole thing off. 

the last and most important problem with the line of questions is many of them did not feel meaningful. for example, there was whats your favorite kind of pizza?
what do you like to do before bed? 

so, i eventually came up with a new system that i have changed over the course of the years. simple set of questions that dont really change from day to day but the answers generally will

the first question comes with some context on why i choose it. remember saying i could deciced what i wanted, well it turns out its a little be easir instead of coming up with something i wanted instead with 
something i am grateful for. the first question/prompt is "things i am especially grateful for today". 
some people might put down the idea of graditude because they think that graditude cant generate a lot happiness. but i ask you a better question have you ever come across someone grateful yet extremely unhappy? 
i have never come across someone like that. maybe theres a few things that annoy them but overall are generally in a great mood. 

the second prompt is simply "how did i focus on someone other than myself". the idea here is simple make another persons day better. i am big beleiver in those around help set your mood. 
i dont know about anybody else but i know that if you have someone your around a lot in the morning unhappy it generally leaves you a little less happy which then makes others less happy. so instead of unintentionally making a terrible negative feedback loop make 
intentional positive loop.

the third question is harder one to follow.  originally when i wrote it out as "what can i improve upon today?". this encourages constant improvement but overtime and a little guidance i realized this focus on sort of failure or problems. 
well, the problem is its not encouraging. there is always going to be more problems but there is never gonna be enough solutions. 
so i changed it to "what did i learn/improve upon today?" this slight change focuses on the positive aspects of a situation just a little bit.

finally the hardest one. 
i had written before "what did i do awesome today?" i had liked the question for the longest time because it encouraged celebrating little things. but the problem is doing something awesome every day is hard and not realistic at all. 
i mean can i honestly say i did something awesome everysingle day? that just sounds exhausting and ineivatable disappointing. also most actions themselves that end with awesome results are not aweomse themselves. 
for example finish building a house is awesome but the action of laying a single brick is not awe inspiring!! 
so i changed it to "how did i challenge myself?" this completes the first goal celebrating the small wins while also not setting an unreasonable goal or ideal. 
you can challenge yourself everyday but you cant do something awesome! 

with all of my history of why i write ths journal and how i hope this inspires your creativity!
 thanks for reading
