umm, i guess rather than doing traditonal programming. I have been playing a fun game called [satisfactory]. 
it  has  currently been filing my automation/engineering itch.
in which you build factories  to build parts in the game.
its starts  out with  really simple parts and low scale number of  machines until later  you grow both in scale and complexity.
 
 if you love  automation and sandbox puzzle game  you will absouletly love this  game.
