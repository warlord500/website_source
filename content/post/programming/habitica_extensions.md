i am excited to show off habitica custom attributes. habitica is simple game system for managing 
things you have to do and habits you have to track that also comes in a game form.

habitica currently only supports single leveling system. i added a script that allows you track xp you gain for completing certain types of tasks. 
you can find more info at the readme.md
