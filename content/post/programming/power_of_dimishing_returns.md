an intresting design in video games is the concept of diminishing returns. 
basically means improving stat might give increase in power or defense effectively forever but also capping it effectively too. 
<!--more-->
this concept is rather intresting to me because it sort of can solve a major problem game designers might have. 
there are two major ways this can be implemented. one is increasing cost with same return or same cost to decreasing improvement. 

its great for cases like damage reduction. where you want to allows players to keep improving defense for basically forever but not actually make them invincible!
in warframe the complete this objective with the armor stat. increases armor always increases defense where you can reach abirtrarily close to 100 percent. 
this was also done in a game called habitica where you can improve your drop chance of items but its still random. 
it uses a math function that caps at 75 percent.  as you max your drop chance improvement you will get closer and closer to that cap but not quite reaching it.

an example of the opposite is in gemcraft. where you can keep building towers however the cost of the towers goes up and only provides the flat benefit of only adding one more gem to run. 
the costs increase while the benefit remains the same. 

while this solves one of the problems of power scaling in games. it can create more fustration because the expected preceived power gain doesnt match the actual power gain. 
making all effort feel futile, fustrating users faster than carefully calibrated system where gains on flat stats are controled. 

the problem with these flat stat systems is that continous improvement is "hard" capped while diminishing returns is "soft" capped! 
soft cap means there is always growth but effort does neccesarily translate into equal better results

i hoped you enjoyed reading my thoughts on this concept.
