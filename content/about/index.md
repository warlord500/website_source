My name is Jadon Belezos. 
I am a passionate young programmer trying to create a website to show what I do on an everyday basis. 
I work every day to make my passions a useful skill for future employers,
whatever my love may be at the time.
Some of my hobbies are building video games, web sites, general programming
First Robotics Competition (FRC), machining, a bit of music on occasion and most certainly a lot of philosophy.
