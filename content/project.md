+ one time pad encryption: [fossil page](/cgi-bin/fossil.cgi/otp_crypt/) (no major changes are planned at this time) 
+ nat_doc_py: [fossil page](/cgi-bin/fossil.cgi/nat_doc_py/) (an old project to try an replace the original [Natural docs](https://www.naturaldocs.org/). I thought the original author was busy at the time)
